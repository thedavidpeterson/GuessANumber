This is a game I created to learn how to switch between screens and how to work with states.

The user enters a number, then the app has to guess which number it is. 
As the app guess a number, the user then has to give a hint if it is lower or higher.
All the guesses (for the round) are saved and displayed. 
Finally, when the app guess right, a summary is shown, stating how many guesses it needed to get right.
